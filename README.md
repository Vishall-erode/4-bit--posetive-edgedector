 4-Bit Edge Detector

 Overview

This project implements a 4-bit Edge Detector to identify transitions (edges) in a 4-bit digital input signal. It detects  rising edges (low to high transitions) in real-time, typically used in digital signal processing, communication systems, and control systems.

Features

- Real-time edge detection for a 4-bit input.
- Compact and efficient design for FPGA, ASIC, or other digital applications.
- Simulated and verified using [specify tools, e.g., Verilog, VHDL, SystemVerilog, etc.].

 Applications

- Digital signal processing.
- Communication systems.
- Industrial automation.
- Event-driven control systems.
